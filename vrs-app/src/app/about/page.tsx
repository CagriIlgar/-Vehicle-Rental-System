          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p className="about-info-text"> 
            Inspired by the growing demand for flexible and user-centric transportation solutions, our journey began with the vision of creating a rental system that goes beyond conventional services. In 2024, under the guidance of Assoc.Prof.Dr Ahmet Ãœnveren, a team of dedicated students envisioned a platform that would combine the convenience of vehicle rentals with advanced features such as real-time logistics, service tracking, and add-on customization. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to excellence, the system was designed to cater to a variety of users, from individuals looking for short-term car rentals to families needing specialized accessories. With a focus on leveraging modern technologies like secure payment gateways, API integration for location tracking, and responsive web design, the project exemplifies how technology can transform traditional services into seamless digital experiences.
