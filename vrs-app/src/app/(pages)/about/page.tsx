            <p>
              Inspired by the growing demand for flexible and user-centric transportation solutions, our journey began with the vision of creating a rental system that goes beyond conventional services.
              <br /><br />
              In 2024, under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ahmet Ãœnveren, a team of dedicated students envisioned a platform that would combine convenience with advanced features like real-time logistics, service tracking, and customizable options.
              <br /><br />
              With a focus on modern technologies such as secure payments, location tracking, and responsive design, Cyrent stands as an innovative approach to digital vehicle rentals.
